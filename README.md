# App::hopen - hopen build system command-line interface



hopen is a cross-platform software build generator.  It makes files you can
pass to Make, Ninja, Visual Studio, or other build tools, to compile and
link your software.  hopen gives you:

- A full, Turing-complete, robust programming language to write your
build scripts (specifically, Perl 5.14+)
- No hidden magic!  All your data is visible and accessible in a build graph.
- Context-sensitivity.  Your users can tweak their own builds for their own
platforms without affecting your project.

See [App::hopen::Conventions](https://metacpan.org/pod/App::hopen::Conventions) for details of the input format.

Why Perl?  Because (1) you probably already have it installed, and
(2) it is the original write-once, run-everywhere language!

# USAGE

    hopen [options] [--] [destination dir [project dir]]

If no project directory is specified, the current directory is used.

If no destination directory is specified, `<project dir>/built` is used.

# OPTIONS

- -a `architecture`

    Specify the architecture.  This is an arbitrary string interpreted by the
    generator or toolset.

- -e `Perl code`

    Add the `Perl code` as if it were a hopen file.  `-e` files are processed
    after all other hopen files, so can modify anything that has been set up
    by those files.  Can be specified more than once.

- --fresh

    Start a fresh build --- ignore any `MY.hopen.pl` file that may exist in
    the destination directory.

- --from `project dir`

    Specify the project directory.  Overrides a project directory given as a
    positional argument.

- -g `generator`

    Specify the generator.  The given `generator` should be either a full package
    name or the part after `App::hopen::Gen::`.

- -t `toolset`

    Specify the toolset.  The given `toolset` should be either a full package
    name or the part after `App::hopen::T::`.

- --to `destination dir`

    Specify the destination directory.  Overrides a destination directory given
    as a positional argument.

- --phase

    Specify which phase of the process to run.  Note that this overrides whatever
    is specified in any MY.hopen.pl file, so may cause unexpected results!

    If `--phase` is given, no other hopen file can set the phase, and hopen will
    terminate if a file attempts to do so.

- -q

    Produce no output (quiet).  Overrides `-v`.

- -v, --verbose=n

    Verbose.  Specify more `v`'s for more verbosity.  At present, `-vv`
    (equivalently, `--verbose=2`) gives
    you detailed traces of the data, and `-vvv` gives you more detailed
    code tracebacks on error.

- --version

    Print the version of hopen and exit

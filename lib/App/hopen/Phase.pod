=head1 NAME

Build::Hopen::Phase - Namespace for hopen phases.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

The specific phases in hopen live under C<Build::Hopen::Phase>.  The
current phases are:

=over

=item L<Build::Hopen::Phase::Probe>

Read a foundations file and one or more context files; output a capability
file and an options file.  The user may edit the options file.

=item L<Build::Hopen::Phase::Gen>

Read the capability, option, and context files, plus a recipes file identifying
the build graph.  Output one or more blueprint files.

=item B<Build>

Not part of hopen --- run the blueprint files through make(1), ninja(1), or
another build tool.

If the dependencies change as the result of a build, the Gen phase is re-run.
However, the Probe phase does not have to be re-run.

=head1 PHILOSOPHY

Hopen is a single-pass build system.  You do not have to re-run to converge
on a final set of blueprint files.

Hopen is context-aware.  You can change the build of a repo without having
to touch files in that repo.
